# Project Background

## Overview

Tough glove has been created for a boxing gym owner who needs a way to present his gym to the world so he can acquire new members. Tough glove is also a system through which members can create an account, see what classes are available and book classes.

Tough glove is based in Dublin, Ireland and is separating itself from other boxing gyms in Ireland by fulfilling an unmet need in people who want to improve their fitness through boxing classes, while also picking up key boxing skills and principles. 

The market in Dublin has a segment of people - typically males between 18 - 50 - who do not want to competitively compete in boxing, but still want to learn the fundamental skills of the sport. Typical boxing gyms either serve as full-fledged amateur boxing gyms that prepare athletes for bouts, or ‘box-fit’ gyms that emphasise fitness over teching sound boxing principles. 

Members want to join a gym where they can improve their fitness, but also learn how to handle themselves appropriately in the ring and ensure they don’t pick up ‘bad habits’ typically seen when people work out in boxfit classes. The goal in boxfit classes is typically to tire out members and keep their heart rate up.

## Problem Statement

Your client is a new boxing club based in Dublin 6, Ireland. The owner is in need of a way to have members book classes (both 1:1 classes and group classes) and keep track of who is attending.

The manager also needs this website to be a marketing channel for his new gym and acquire new members. Therefore he needs to be able to communicate what differentiates his classes from other boxing gyms. This would involve a website that has a strong landing page to convert website visitors. The website needs to convey the value proposition of a high-paced boxing class that places equal value on good fundamental boxing skill building.

## Research: 

- User Interviews: 1:1 interviews were conducted with existing gym members, and also potential new gym members, to determine what goals they have and what messaging and value propositions appeal to them. 
- Competitive Analysis: Examining competing boxing gym classes and websites revealed existing offerings and their strengths and weaknesses. This informed our choice of target market, value proposition, messaging and strategy.
- User Testing: Usability testing of existing flows were carried out with existing gym members to examine how they navigate the system and competitor solutions (Glofox & Squarespace)

### Design

- I began the process by designing wireframes of the site in order to get an overall understanding of the user flows and necessary pages to achieve the client outcomes.
- I converted the wireframes into [a figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/9gEj83rMB6EfxZzyMkmk81/Tough-Glove-Medium-Fidelity-Design?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=501-39&viewport=290%2C3902%2C0.52&t=QolXKX1XZCvxny5F-1&scaling=scale-down-width) to determine the flow, color schemes and typography that would be used.
- These prototypes were shared with the gym owner who gave some initial feedback to ensure it achieved their objectives. The messaging and branding was accepted by the owners. I confirmed that the business objectives were met with the figma prototype. 
- The design was then tested with current gym members to ensure they understood the proposition and were able to navigate the prototype without confusion.
- The logo, typeface and colour scheme were chosen to reflect the Tough Glove gym ethos of challenging oneself, respect for the science of boxing and professionalism.

### Agile Development

Agile software development methods were used to deliver this project and ensure that an iterative approach was taken to acheive the best results for the end-user. 
- The project was broken down from the high level business outcomes and problem statement into epics and user stories. 
- The end user's requirements were written from the end user's perspective to help make sure the right features were being built in a user-centric way.

A github projects board was used to track and manage the expected workload involved in this project, and break it down into a list of epics, and then further into user stories that could be worked towards to build the site on time.
- Each user story was written with a clear description following the convention of "As a ____, I want to ______, so that ____"
- A points system was used to estimate the effort involved with each story
- The end user goal and end business goal was clearly articulated on each story, along with the acceptance criteria. 
- Each story contained the necessary tasks required to complete them and achieve the acceptance criteria.

User stories were prioritized using the MoSCow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
