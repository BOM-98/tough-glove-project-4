        Test the successful creation of
        a class instance in the system.

        This test method verifies that a class
        instance has been correctly created and
        initialized with the expected
        attribute values. It is essential to ensure
        that the class creation process is functioning
        as intended, as this
        forms the basis of managing class schedules
        and availability in the system.

        The test checks the following attributes of
        the class instance:
        - class_name: Ensures that the name of the
        class is correctly set to 'Test Class'.
        - slots_available: Confirms that the number
        of available slots is correctly initialized to 10.
        - slots_filled: Verifies that the initial
        count of filled slots is 0, indicating no bookings yet.

        Assertions:
        - Asserts that the class_name attribute of
        the class instance matches 'Test Class'.
        - Asserts that the slots_available attribute
        is correctly set to 10.
        - Asserts that the slots_filled attribute
        starts at 0, indicating an empty class at creation.

        This test is crucial for validating the
        integrity of the class creation process.
        It ensures that when a new class
        is created, it has the correct initial settings,
        which is fundamental for the accurate tracking
        and management of
        class bookings and availability.

        associated with the intended user.
        - class_id: Verifies that the booking is correctly
        linked to the specific class.

        Assertions:
        - Asserts that the user attribute of the booking
        instance matches the expected user object.
        - Asserts that the class_id attribute of the booking
        instance is correctly set to the intended class object.

        Test that the slots available and slots filled
        for a class are decremented when a booking is created.

        This test method ensures the correct functionality
        of the slot management system within the class booking process.
        It specifically tests two scenarios:
        1. The decrement of available slots and increment
        of filled slots when a new booking is created.
        2. The increment of available slots and decrement
        of filled slots when an existing booking is deleted.

        Assertions:
        - Initially asserts that the 'slots_available' and
        'slots_filled' are at their default values
        (10 and 0 respectively).
        - After deleting a booking, asserts that
        'slots_available' is incremented and 'slots_filled'
        is decremented,
        reflecting the removal of the booking.

        Note - incrementing and decrementing slots for
        new bookings made
        is handled by the BookingForm resulting in 11
        and -1 respectively for this test.
