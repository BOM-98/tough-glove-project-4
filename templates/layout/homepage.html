                        are endured when competing at an elite level, bringing this wisdom to each class. Where better
                        to learn than from the pugilists themselves?</p>

                    <p>Our classes have been designed using a training system that incorporates the perfect balance of
                        both physical fitness and technical skills giving participants the best bang for their buck.</p>
